### Explanation of Files

- **server.js**: The main server code that listens for DNS requests and responds with domain resolution.
- **dnsRecords.js**: This file contains hardcoded DNS records. You can extend it to fetch records from a database.
- **cache.js**: Implements caching to store DNS records temporarily.
- **config.js**: Holds configuration settings like TTL (time-to-live) and port number.
- **logger.js**: Handles logging of DNS requests.
- **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration for containerizing the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for setting up and running the DNS server.

### Adding Advanced Features
To add more advanced features like GeoDNS or DNSSEC, you would need to expand the `server.js` and `dnsRecords.js` files. You could add an API for managing records dynamically, and integrate security features in `server.js`.
